# debiometricizer

A project by @dabanus for allowing research teams on artificial intelligence approaches to generate massive image and video datasets without compromising personal rights and privacy of the persons in thoise datasets.

# To do:

1. Define the pipeline architecture. must be possible to load onto deep learning accelerator platforms like Movidius, Jetson-Nano, Sipeed-MAix, Edge-TPU and others (this list needs to be watched closely, as about monthly there are new hardware platforms being launched) 

2. Obtain a dedicated hardware for developing, testing and training the models 
   1. Define the process for image data (make person recognition from image impossible or at least very unlikely)
   2. define the process for video data (make person recognition from video impossible or at least very unlikely)
   3. Define the process for audio data (make voice recognition imnpossible or at least very unlikely)


3. For Prototyping, select hardware platfom to run the pipeline on. 

4. Team up with users for this tech and launch prototype surveillance camera and verify the image/video quality as well as the lack of biometric information.
